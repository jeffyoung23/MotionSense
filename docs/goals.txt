Motion Sense Goals

10/6/10: Find some way to store images of gestures
	 A gesture should have
	   >  a pattern(level one, level two, etc)
	   >  an image, so the user knows what to replicate
	   >  an event, trigger some script, redirect, etc
	   
Some later point introduce gestures based on regions, not just motions.
i.e. if I do a semi circle around the corner of a square <div> then it should
rotate in relation to the direction and speed of the semi-circle.
